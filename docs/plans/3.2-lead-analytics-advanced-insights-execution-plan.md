### Integration with Existing Code

**No Modifications Required:**

- ✅ `crm_lead_scoring_service.py`: Use as-is for score correlation
- ✅ `audit_logs` table: Use for stage timing analysis
- ✅ `pipeline-metrics.tsx`: Existing patterns for new components
- ✅ Organization middleware: Automatic multi-tenancy enforcement

**Extension Points:**

- ✅ `api/main.py`: Add analytics router registration
- ✅ `app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx`: Add analytics navigation
- ✅ Navigation: Extend existing CRM menu structure

### Performance Considerations

**Database Optimization:**

- Materialized view for daily metrics (refresh every hour)
- Selective indexing for analytics queries
- Connection pooling for concurrent dashboard users
- Query result caching with Redis (5-minute TTL)

**Frontend Optimization:**

- Component memoization for expensive chart renders
- Lazy loading for non-critical dashboard sections
- Intelligent polling (slower refresh when document hidden)
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**

1. **Performance Degradation**: Materialized views + caching + query optimization
2. **Data Isolation**: Comprehensive testing of organization filtering
3. **Scalability**: Designed for 1000+ leads per organization
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Recharts 2.15.4 supports all modern browsers

**Business Risks:**

1. **Data Accuracy**: Extensive validation against Story 3.1 calculations
2. **Usability**: Mobile-first design with touch optimization
3. **Adoption**: Clear value demonstration with ROI identification
4. **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization throughout
