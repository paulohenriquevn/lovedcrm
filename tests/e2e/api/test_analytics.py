"""End-to-end integration tests for Analytics API.

Comprehensive integration tests validating the complete analytics system:
- API endpoints with proper authentication
- Cross-organization data isolation
- Performance under realistic load
- Integration with Story 3.1 services
- Error handling validation
- Real database operations

Test Environment Requirements:
- Test database with sample data
- Redis for caching tests
- Authentication tokens
- Multiple test organizations
